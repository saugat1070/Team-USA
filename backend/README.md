## About

**Paila** is a location-powered community fitness platform that turns walking and running into a shared game. Users are automatically placed into live, district-based rooms using real-time coordinates, where they can track activity together, compete locally, and build territory through valid walking or running routes.

The platform streams live location updates using sockets, enabling group walks, shared visibility, and real-time validation. Completed activities are processed into GeoJSON LineString and Polygon data, allowing accurate distance, area, and territory calculations. Leaderboards rank users based on distance covered, territory claimed, and consistency, while rewards and streaks encourage long-term engagement rather than short bursts of activity.

Paila also includes a content layer with curated routes and blogs that highlight popular paths, community achievements, and local exploration opportunities, helping users connect movement with place and culture.
